              <strong>1. The Conflict of Interest: Misaligned Incentives</strong>
            </h3>
            <p className="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The fundamental reason many disciplined businesses haven't heard about captives is that the stakeholders involved do not benefit when you switch to a captive.

                  <strong>Brokers:</strong>
                </h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed">
                  Traditional brokers are primarily compensated by a 10-20%+ annual commission based on the total premium dollars they place with carriers. <strong className="text-foreground">Their incentive is to maximize your premium spend, not to help you retain it.</strong> Recommending a captive program—which immediately shifts a large portion of your premium into an asset—reduces their commission and the overall risk market they participate in.

                <p className="text-sm text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed">
                  Traditional insurance carriers profit by collecting more premiums than they spend on claims. Every dollar your company pays into a captive is a dollar your traditional carrier loses in underwriting profit and investment income. They have no interest in marketing a structure that competes with their business model.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Until recently, the complexity of establishing a quality captive program acted as an effective barrier to entry for the mid-market.

                  A captive is, by definition, an insurance company. Setting one up requires specialized legal, tax, accounting, and regulatory expertise. Historically, the administrative and legal fees made the process cost-prohibitive for all but the largest corporations.
